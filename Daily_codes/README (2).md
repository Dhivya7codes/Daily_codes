Java Practice Repository
This repository contains a collection of Java programs developed as part of my regular coding practice. The objective is to reinforce core programming principles, enhance problem-solving abilities, and maintain consistency in coding.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
A wide range of beginner to intermediate-level Java programs

Key topics covered include:

Control structures (if-else, loops, switch)

Arrays, strings, and functions

Fundamentals of object-oriented programming (to be expanded over time)

This repository will be updated regularly as I continue to build my proficiency in Java.
